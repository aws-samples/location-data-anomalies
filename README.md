# Location Data Anomalies

## About this Solution
This solution was built in conjunction with AWS Re:Invent 2022 for a chalk talk titled "How to build location-aware workflows to detect data anomalies" delivered by Matt Nightingale and Drishti Arora.

The solution is intended as quickstart guide for an ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) workflow that uses AWS Glue DataBrew, AWS Glue ETL Jobs (Python), and Amazon Location Service to flag and enrich location data anomalies.
